# Building your Web App with Amplify and configuring LEX

## Overview

Amplify is an open-source Framework provides the following products to build fullstack iOS, Android, Web, and React Native apps:

- Amplify CLI - Configure all the services needed to power your backend through a simple command line interface.
- Amplify Libraries - Use case-centric client libraries to integrate your app code with a backend using declarative interfaces.
- Amplify UI Components - UI libraries for React, React Native, Angular, Ionic and Vue.
- Amplify Console - Is an AWS service that provides a git-based workflow for continuous deployment & hosting of fullstack web apps. Cloud resources created by the Amplify CLI are also visible in the Amplify Console.

We'll use Amplify to build a web application in which we can interact with our LEX chat bot from Lab 1.

## Pre-requisites

The following frameworks and package managers are needed to be able to complete Lab 2:
- NodeJS version 10.x and above (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- npm version 6.x and above (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Step 1: Install the Amplify CLI

1. Run the following command within terminal / powershell window:

``` bash
sudo npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

* please note that Amplify CLI will need to be installed globally on your machine hence ``` sudo ``` is needed

2. Configure Amplify by running the following command:

``` bash
amplify configure
```

3. Amplify CLI will ask you to specify the AWS Region. Enter: ```us-east-1```

``` bash
Specify the AWS Region
? region: us-east-1
```

4. Amplify CLI will now ask you to create an IAM user. Enter: ```lex-lab-amplify```

``` bash
Specify the username of the new IAM user:
? user name: lex-lab-amplify
```

5. You will be directed to complete the user creation using the AWS console. Create a user with ```AdministratorAccess``` to your account to provision AWS resources for you like AppSync, Cognito etc.

6. Once the user is created, Amplify CLI will ask you to provide the ```accessKeyId``` and the ```secretAccessKey``` to connect Amplify CLI with your newly created IAM user. Profile Name should be ```lex-lab-amplify-profile```.

``` bash
Enter the access key of the newly created user:
? accessKeyId:  # YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
? secretAccessKey:  # YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine
? Profile Name:  # (lex-lab-amplify-profile)

Successfully set up the new user.
```

## Step 2: Create a new project
To set up the project, we’ll first create a new React app with create-react-app, a CLI tool used to bootstrap a React app using current best practices. We’ll then add Amplify and initialize a new project.

1. From your projects directory, run the following commands:

``` bash
npx create-react-app react-lexchatbot
cd react-lexchatbot
```

This creates a new React app in a directory called react-lexchatbot and then switches us into that new directory.

2. Now that we’re in the root of the project, we can run the app by using the following command:

``` bash
npm start
```

This runs a development server and allows us to see the output generated by the build, you can see the running app by navigating to ```http://localhost:3000```

## Step 3: Setup Amplify CLI
Now that we have a running React app, it’s time to set up Amplify so that we can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app.

1. From the root of the project, launch a second terminal window / powershell window and run:

``` bash
amplify init
```

2. When you initialize Amplify you’ll be prompted for some information about the app. Firstly provide a name for the project - let's go with ```lexchatbot```.

``` bash
Enter a name for the project (lexchatbot)
```

3. You will then be asked for an name for your environment - call it ```dev```

``` bash
# All AWS services you provision for your app are grouped into an "environment"
# A common naming convention is dev, staging, and production
Enter a name for the environment (dev)
```

4. You will then be prompted for your default editor - choose ```Visual Studio Code``` and tap ```enter```.

``` bash
# Sometimes the CLI will prompt you to edit a file, it will use this editor to open those files.
Choose your default editor
> Visual Studio Code
...
```

5. Select ```javascript``` as the type of app you are building.

``` bash
# Amplify supports JavaScript (Web & React Native), iOS, and Android apps
Choose the type of app that you're building (javascript)
android
ios
> javascript
```

6. Choose ```react``` as the javascript framework we will use.

``` bash
What javascript framework are you using?
angular
ember
ionic
> react
react-native
vue
none
```

7. Leave the src path as default by pressing ```enter```.

``` bash
Source directory path (src)
```

8. Leave the distribution directory path as default by pressing ```enter```.

``` bash
Distribution directory path (build)
```

9. Leave the cuild command as default by pressing ```enter```.

``` bash
Build command (npm build)
```

10. Leave the start command as default by pressing ```enter```.

``` bash
Start command (npm start)
```

11. Type ```Y``` to use an AWS profile and then select ```lex-lab-amplify-profile```.

``` bash
# This is the profile you created with the `amplify configure` command in the introduction step.
Do you want to use an AWS profile (Y/n): Y
default
> lex-lab-amplify-profile
```

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

* It creates a top level directory called amplify that stores your backend definition. As you add features, the amplify folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.

* It creates a file called aws-exports.js in the src directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.

* It modifies the .gitignore file, adding some generated files to the ignore list

* A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running amplify console. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources

## Step 4: Configure Amplify for the App
1. The first step to using Amplify in the client is to install the necessary dependencies:

``` bash
npm install aws-amplify aws-amplify-react
```

The aws-amplify package is the main library for working with Amplify in your apps. 

The aws-amplify-react package includes React specific UI components we’ll use as we build the app.

2. Next, we need to configure Amplify on the client so that we can use it to interact with our backend services.

Open **App/index.js** and add the following code below the last import:

``` javascript
import Amplify from "aws-amplify";
import awsExports from "./aws-exports";
Amplify.configure(awsExports);
```

And that’s all it takes to configure Amplify. As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in aws-exports.js will update automatically.

Now that our React app is set up and Amplify is initialized, we’re ready to add LEX in the next step.

## Step 5: Set up Amazon LEX within the App
1.  Within the AWS Console navigate to
